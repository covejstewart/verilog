Bowling Kata
http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBowling

This is adopted from a java coding example, and I am assuming that the DUT module be written in synthesizable RTL, so all checking will be in the TestBench

Some key points about the Kata. . .

We will not check for valid rolls.
We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.
